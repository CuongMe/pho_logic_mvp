        <article class="policy-card">
          <h2>10) Data Retention</h2>
          <p>
            The developer does not store user accounts. Retention of analytics/advertising data is handled by Google services and

        </article>

        <article class="policy-card">
          <h2>11) Security</h2>
          <p>
            I take reasonable steps to protect information and to keep the App up to date. However, no method of transmission
            over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.
          </p>
          <p>
            The App does not operate its own user account system or private database. Advertising and analytics functions are
            provided through Google services (such as Google Play Services, Google AdMob, and Firebase Analytics). Data processed
            by these services is protected according to their security practices, policies, and settings.

        <article class="policy-card">
          <h2>13) Feedback (Google Forms)</h2>
          <p>
            I offer an optional feedback form to help improve the App. <strong>Providing feedback is completely optional</strong>
            and not required to use the App.
          </p>
          <p>
            The feedback form is hosted by <strong>Google Forms</strong>, a third-party service operated by Google. When you submit
            feedback through this form:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>I do not collect email addresses</strong> through the form.</li>
            <li><strong>I do not require you to sign in</strong> or authenticate to submit feedback.</li>
            <li>
              The only data collected is what you voluntarily type into the form fields (such as your comments, suggestions, or
              optional demographic information if present).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Please do not include sensitive personal information (such as financial data, passwords,
            government IDs, or health information) in your feedback. The form is intended for general comments and suggestions
            about the App only.
